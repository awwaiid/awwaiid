[Ghostwriter](https://github.com/awwaiid/ghostwriter) - An exploration using the eInk reMarkable2 tablet as an interface to vision/LLM models. Imagine taking hand-written notes and having them automatically add to your TODO list. Or how about a nice game of tic-tac-toe?

[Token Tree](https://github.com/awwaiid/token-tree) - Visualize alternate LLM token generation paths to gain intuition about how LLMs work. See the [Project Page](https://thelackthereof.org/llm-token-tree-visualization) and try the [Live Version](https://thelackthereof.org/token-tree/).

[REPL-LOOPER](https://github.com/awwaiid/repl-looper) - A [Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) script for mashing up a programming REPL and music creation. Visualize and interact with loops as rows on the [Grid](https://monome.org/docs/grid/).

[Mizik](https://github.com/awwaiid/mizik) - Repeat the chain! Use the sounds to remember. Extra points when the chain doubles back! Fun little game of memory on a hexagon grid playing isometrically aligned tones.
